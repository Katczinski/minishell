# Minishell
A simple posix shell.

The objective of this project is to create a "simple" shell.
It was the first group project in my 42 cursus, we were a team of 2.
We had to implement 6 built-ins like in bash :

-echo (with -n option)

-cd

-pwd

-export

-unset

-env

-exit


We also had to handle redirections, pipes, environment variables and some signals.
